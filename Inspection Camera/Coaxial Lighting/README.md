# Venturi Pick and Place - Camera - Coaxial Lighting

## Overview:
An attempt to make make a coaxial lighting camera setup for an OpenPnP setup using accessible and equipment.
The setup is intended to be used with the open-source Venturi pick and place but is compatible with the Index PnP as well. 

## Print Recommendations:
It's recommended to print this in ABS, using the standard Voron Design print recommendations.
4-6 walls, 40% Infill. The purpose is to create a sturdy mount that can handle the heat from the camera and LEDs.


## BOM:

## Versions:
### V2
Optimized to work with the Venturi, using Voron standard heat-set inserts to mount a LED source. Further improvements include lip for LED diffuser, wider/more robust design.

### V1
A first attempt and proof-of-concept, this design is smaller and does not allow for easy LED mounting, but is great for space-limited setups.


## To-do list:
[] Design LED source, perhaps with Fresnel lenses?
[] Write a step by step guide
[] Improve cable management
