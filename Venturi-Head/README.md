# Venturi Pick and Place - Head

## Overview:
Attempt to repurpose the Voron Afterburner to be a pick and place head. The setup uses dual MGN7 linear rails and is designed to be 3D printable. The head is intended to be used on the open-source Venturi pick and place, which is based on the Voron V1.8 design. This is still a work in progress, and testing still needs to validate the design. 

## Print Recommendations:
It's recommended to print this in ABS, using the standard Voron Design print recommendations.
4-6 walls, 40% Infill. The purpose is to create a sturdy mount that can handle the heat from the camera and LEDs.


## BOM:

## Versions:
### V1
A first attempt and proof-of-concept, this design has been tested on a prototype machine and seems to work well. The design needs to be optimized further and is dependant on hitting good tolerances. 


## To-do list:
[ ] Redesign for dual MGN12 rails for X-Axis?

[ ] Integrate with unreleased Venturi Electronics

[ ] Improve cable management
